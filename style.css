Description:        Diaz Gill is comprised of a few separate technologies. The back-end is powered by Sage, modular Wordpress starter kit. The front-end is powered by a GraphQL-powered Node application consuming the Wordpress JSON API via the Apollo Stack. Once data is consumed templates are rendered by React on the server-side and rehydrated on the client.
